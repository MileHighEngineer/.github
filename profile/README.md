# Welcome to Mile High Engineer 👋

Hey there! Welcome to the Github home of [Mile High Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/@milehighengineer) — where I build, break, and share all kinds of cool stuff.

## What I Make

I'm passionate about creating different things across disciplines:

- **Software** — Apps, tools, and scripts that solve real problems
- **Hardware** — PCBs, electronics, and custom builds
- **Robotics** — Robots that move, sense, and think
- **Experiments** — Whatever idea I'm curious about this week

## Explore My Work

Check out the repositories here to dive into specific projects. Each one usually has its own README with setup instructions, wiring diagrams, or code walkthrough.
